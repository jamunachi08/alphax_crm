"""AlphaX BI Dashboard — the master screen unifying the whole "AlphaX ...
(BI)" report family (crm/bi_report.py) into one tabbed page, instead of
leaving each report only reachable one at a time from the Report List.

This module does not recompute anything: it is a thin dispatcher that
calls each report's own, already-tested execute() function server-side
with one shared filter payload (As Of Date / Period Type / Compare Mode /
Years Back / Sales Person / Source / City / Business Unit) and returns
every report's (columns, data, message, chart, report_summary) tuple in
one combined JSON response, keyed by a short id the page's JS uses to pick
which tab to render it into. Keeping all the real logic in the reports
themselves means this dashboard can never drift out of sync with what
running the report directly would show -- there is exactly one
implementation of each metric, not two.
