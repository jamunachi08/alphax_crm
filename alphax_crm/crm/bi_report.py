"""Shared engine behind the "AlphaX ... (BI)" report family — the live,
database-backed equivalent of the Lead Tracker BI Excel workbook: one period
engine (Daily/Weekly/.../Yearly + an optional prior-year comparison), reused
by every report in the family instead of each one reinventing it.

Design notes (why this looks the way it does):

* Lead Stage values (the native ``status`` field) are NOT hardcoded here.
  They come from the Select field's own options on whichever site this runs
  on (``get_lead_stage_options``), because this app lets that list be
  extended per-customer (``ensure_select_option`` / Lead Status -> Lead
  Stage Mapping) — a hardcoded stage list would silently go stale the next
  time someone adds a stage.
* "Movement into a stage during a period" comes from AlphaX Stage Transition
  Log (crm/activity.py: record_transition), which already timestamps every
  Lead Stage change — this is the event log a BI report needs; nothing new
  had to be added to capture it.
* The Log only stores reference_name, not the Lead's own dimension fields
  (owner/source/city/business unit/stage), so filtering by those means a
  second, bulk lookup against Lead and an in-Python join — the same
  python-side-aggregation style already used by this app's other reports
  (alphax_sales_pipeline_forecast.py, alphax_stage_duration_report.py)
  rather than a hand-rolled SQL JOIN.
